Forge is a dependency injection framework for Node.js. It was originally built as an experiment,
but is now in use in production at [Adzerk](http://adzerk.com/), where the software it powers
handles billions of requests each month.

## New in 0.10.1

Forge now properly supports ES6/TypeScript classes.

## New in 0.10.0

CoffeeScript 1.9.x made a change to the way variables are named, which confuses the secret voodoo
that Forge uses to determine the names of constructor arguments. If more than one variable shares
the same name in a scope, CoffeeScript will rename them to `foo`, `foo1`, `foo2`, etc.

To solve this problem, Forge (as of 0.10.0) will now truncate any trailing digits from the names
of arguments. This is a breaking change from previous versions, but shouldn't be a problem unless
you've intentionally declared bindings with names ending in digits. (Forge will now also throw
an error if you attempt to declare such a binding.)

If you'd like to switch to the previous behavior, you can pass a flag to the `Forge` constructor:

```coffeescript
forge = new Forge({unmangleNames: false})
```

Note, also, that the Forge constructor signature has changed, so if you were passing in your
own custom `Inspector` for some reason, it is now part of the config hash:

```coffeescript
forge = new Forge({inspector: new MyCustomInspector()})
```

## Foreward, and forewarning

First things first: I'm fairly certain that the existence of this framework will be controversial.
The general sentiment is that in a loosely-typed, dynamic language like JavaScript, framework-aided
dependency injection is unnecessary.

Having now written two sizable projects in Node, I've come to believe that an object-oriented
approach backed by a dependency injection system is the most effective way to develop complex systems.

This is something I built to scratch my own itch, and have released it in the hopes that others
will find it useful as well.

## Getting started

You can install Forge from npm:

```
$ npm install forge-di
```

## So how's it work?

The API of Forge is inspired by some of my previous work on [Ninject](http://ninject.org),
a dependency injection framework for .NET. I wouldn't go so far as to call Forge "Ninject for Node,"
but it's not an entirely unreasonable moniker.

Forge allows you to define loosely-coupled components in a declarative way, and then wires them
together for you as necessary. Here's a quick example of typical usage:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

# A class with a single dependency
class Foo
  constructor: (@bar) ->

# A class with no dependencies
class Bar
  constructor: ->

# Declare your bindings
forge = new Forge()
forge.bind('foo').to.type(Foo)
forge.bind('bar').to.type(Bar)

# Resolve an instance, and Forge resolves the dependency graph for you
obj = forge.get('foo')
assert(obj instanceof Foo)
assert(obj.bar instanceof Bar)
```

Forge works by examining the names of the constructor parameters on your types. In the example above,
the constructor of the class `Foo` had a parameter called `bar`. Forge sees this as a dependency,
resolves the component named `bar` and passes the resolved instance to the constructor of `Foo`.

Instead of constructors, you can also bind to functions, which Forge will call to resolve
the dependency. (This is helpful if you need to do something more manual to resolve the dependency.)
If the function has any parameters, Forge will attempt to resolve them when calling the function.

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class Foo
  constructor: (@bar) ->

class Bar
  constructor: ->

# A simple factory function with a single dependency
createFoo = (bar) -> new Foo(bar)

# Declare a binding to the function, and another to the dependency it requires
forge = new Forge()
forge.bind('foo').to.function(createFoo)
forge.bind('bar').to.type(Bar)

# Forge will call the function
foo = forge.get('foo')
assert(foo instanceof Foo)
assert(foo.bar instanceof Bar)
```

## Multiple bindings for a single component

You can also register multiple bindings for a single component name. For example, you might want
to create a class that can operate as a facade over an arbitrary number of plugins:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class PluginOne
  constructor: ->

class PluginTwo
  constructor: ->

class Facade
  constructor: (@plugins) ->

# Register multiple bindings for the "plugins" component
forge = new Forge()
forge.bind('plugins').to.type(PluginOne)
forge.bind('plugins').to.type(PluginTwo)
forge.bind('facade').to.type(Facade)

# Forge passes an array of instances to the Facade constructor
facade = forge.get('facade')
assert(typeof facade.plugins == 'array')
assert(facade.plugins.length == 2)
assert(facade.plugins[0] instanceof PluginOne)
assert(facade.plugins[1] instanceof PluginTwo)
```

To support this behavior, `Forge.get()` will return a single instance when only one matching
binding is available, and an array of instances when multiple bindings are available.

To be certain that you only resolve a single instance, you can call `Forge.getOne()` instead.
This function will throw an exception if more than one matching binding would be resolved.

If, instead, you want to resolve *all* bindings for a given component, you can call `Forge.getAll()`.
This will ignore the conditions specified on the bindings, and resolve all of them. This
function will always return an array of instances, even if only a single instance was resolved.

## Conditional bindings and resolution hints

Since you can register multiple bindings for a single component, you might not always want
to resolve all of them for a given scenario. To allow this, Forge supports *conditional bindings*,
which are bindings with a predicate attached. These predicates examine *resolution hints*
that you pass to `Forge.get()`. For example:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class RedFoo
  constructor: ->

class BlueFoo
  constructor: ->

# Register multiple bindings to the same component, with predicates
forge = new Forge()

# Here's the short form, which just does an equality (==) check against the hint:
forge.bind('foo').to.type(RedFoo).when('red')

# And here's the long form, which allows you to pass in a predicate function:
forge.bind('foo').to.type(BlueFoo).when (hint) -> hint == 'blue'

# Forge passes the resolution hint to the bindings' predicates to determine which to resolve
foo1 = forge.get('foo', 'red')
foo2 = forge.get('foo', 'blue')
assert(foo1 instanceof RedFoo)
assert(foo2 instanceof BlueFoo)
```

Hints don't need to be scalars; they can be anything you want, as long as the predicates
associated with your conditional bindings understand how to evaluate them.

If multiple bindings match, `Forge.get()` will return an array of results.
(See [Multiple Bindings for a Single Component](#multiple-bindings-for-a-single-component) above.)

## Dependency hints

If you don't want to rely on the convention of naming your constructor arguments the same as your
components, you can add *dependency hints* to your types instead. The syntax is reminiscent
of `use strict`:

```coffeescript
class TypeWithHints
  constructor: (@dependency1, @dependency2) ->
    "dependency1 -> foo"
    "dependency2 -> bar"
```

When Forge creates an instance of `TypeWithHints`, instead of trying to resolve components named
`dependency1` and `dependency2`, instead it will read the hints, and resolve components named `foo`
and `bar` instead.

If you have [conditional bindings](#conditional-bindings-and-resolution-hints) registered, you can
use dependency hints to specify that you'd like to resolve *all* of the available components,
regardless of whether conditions have been set.

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class RedPlugin
  constructor: ->

class BluePlugin
  constructor: ->

class Facade
  constructor: (@plugins) ->
    "plugins -> all plugin"

# Register multiple conditional bindings for the "plugin" component
forge = new Forge()
forge.bind('plugin').to.type(RedPlugin).when('red')
forge.bind('plugin').to.type(BluePlugin).when('blue')
forge.bind('facade').to.type(Facade)

# Forge disregards the conditions and passes an array of instances to the Facade constructor
facade = forge.get('facade')
assert(typeof facade.plugins == 'array')
assert(facade.plugins.length == 2)
assert(facade.plugins[0] instanceof RedPlugin)
assert(facade.plugins[1] instanceof BluePlugin)
```

Finally, if you have conditional bindings registered, and you'd only like to resolve a single one,
you can specify an additional hint you'd like to use to resolve the dependency in the hint itself.
(Yo dawg, I heard you like hints...)

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class RedPlugin
  constructor: ->

class BluePlugin
  constructor: ->

class Facade
  constructor: (@plugin) ->
    "plugin -> plugin: blue"

# Register multiple conditional bindings for the "plugin" component
forge = new Forge()
forge.bind('plugin').to.type(RedPlugin).when('red')
forge.bind('plugin').to.type(BluePlugin).when('blue')
forge.bind('facade').to.type(Facade)

# Forge uses the additional hint to determine which conditional binding to resolve
facade = forge.get('facade')
assert(facade.plugin instanceof BluePlugin)
```

## Lifecycles

By default, once a binding has been resolved, the result will be cached and re-used for
subsequent requests. This is called a *singleton* lifecycle, after the pattern of the same
name.

You can define a lifecycle for a binding using the following syntax:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class Foo
  constructor: (@bar) ->

class Bar
  constructor: ->

forge = new Forge()

# Since singleton is the default lifecycle, you can also omit .as.singleton()
forge.bind('foo').to.type(Foo)
forge.bind('bar').to.type(Bar).as.singleton()

# The instance of Bar is created on the first request, and then is re-used when creating Foo
bar = forge.get('bar')
foo = forge.get('foo')
assert(foo.bar === bar)
```

Forge also supports a *transient* lifecycle, which means that a new result will be resolved
on each request for a given component. Here's the same example as above, using the transient
lifecycle instead:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class Foo
  constructor: (@bar) ->

class Bar
  constructor: ->

forge = new Forge()

forge.bind('foo').to.type(Foo)
forge.bind('bar').to.type(Bar).as.transient()

# There were two instances of Bar created
bar = forge.get('bar')
foo = forge.get('foo')
assert(foo.bar !== bar)
```

## Explicit arguments

Rather than allowing Forge to figure everything out for you, sometimes you may want
to take manual control over part of the dependency resolution process. To allow this,
Forge lets you supply *explicit arguments* to your bindings, overriding dependencies
by name.

Here's an example:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

# A class with a single dependency
class Foo
  constructor: (@bar) ->

# Manually create an instance of the dependency
manuallyCreatedBar = new Bar()

# Tell the binding when "bar" is requested, just return the instance we just manually created.
forge = new Forge()
forge.bind('foo').to.type(Foo).with(bar: manuallyCreatedBar)

# Forge will pass the explicit argument to the constructor of Foo
foo = forge.get('foo')
assert(foo instanceof Foo)
assert(foo.bar === manuallyCreatedBar)
```

You can also use this to specify arguments to bound functions. This is helpful to create
factory functions if you need them:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

# A factory function with a single argument
create = (bar) -> new Foo(bar)

# Manually create an instance of the dependency
manuallyCreatedBar = new Bar()

# Explicitly set the value for the parameter named "bar"
forge = new Forge()
forge.bind('foo').to.function(createFoo).with(bar: manuallyCreatedBar)

# Forge will pass the explicit argument to the function.
foo = forge.get()
assert(foo instanceof Foo)
assert(foo.bar === manuallyCreatedBar)
```

Note: if (for some reason) you specify a [dependency hint](#dependency-hints) on one of
the arguments to a constructor or function, the explicit argument name must match the
*hinted name*, not the *actual name* of the argument.

## Dependencies on the Forge itself

Sometimes, you might want your components to do on-demand resolution of dependencies,
rather than having them injected immediately when the component is created. To do this,
you can create a factory type, or you can just ask Forge to pass a reference of itself
to the created component.

Here's an example of a dependency on the Forge itself:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class DependsOnForge
  constructor: (@forge) ->

forge = new Forge()
forge.bind('dependent').to.type(DependsOnForge)

obj = forge.get('dependent')
assert(obj instanceof DependsOnForge)
assert(obj.forge === forge)
```

*Use this sparingly!* You should always favor constructor injection to service location.

## Ephemeral Bindings

Sometimes you don't want to register all of your types with the Forge, instead only
resolving their dependencies. If you already know what type you want to resolve,
you can pass it to `Forge.create()` to request that its dependencies be resolved,
and an instance be created.

For example:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class Foo
  constructor: ->

class DependsOnFoo
  constructor: (@foo) ->

forge = new Forge()
forge.bind('foo').to.type(Foo)

obj = forge.create(DependsOnFoo)
assert(obj instanceof DependsOnFoo)
assert(obj.foo instanceof Foo)
```

This effectively creates a temporary transient binding to `DependsOnFoo` that will only be
resolved during the call to `Forge.create()`, and then discarded. You should avoid using
this feature unless you're sure it's what you want. Most of your types should be registered
as normal bindings, particularly if:

1. You're resolving a dependency on the Forge itself in order to call `Forge.create()`.
2. The type you're resolving via `Forge.create()` is a dependency of another type.

## Unbinding and Rebinding

Forge supports altering bindings after they have been defined via two methods:

1. `unbind()`, which removes any existing binding and does not replace it.
2. `rebind()`, which removes any existing bindings and begins a new binding definition.

Here's an example of unbinding:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class Foo
  constructor: ->

forge = new Forge()
forge.bind('a').to.type(Foo)

# Returns the number of bindings that were removed.
count = forge.unbind('a')
assert(count == 1)

# This will throw a ResolutionError.
forge.get('a')
```

And here's an example of rebinding:

```coffeescript
Forge = require 'forge-di'

class Foo
  constructor: ->

class Bar
  constructor: ->

forge = new Forge()

forge.bind('a').to.type(Foo)
a = forge.get(Foo)
assert(a instanceof Foo)

forge.rebind('a').to.type(Bar)
a = forge.get('a')
assert(a instanceof Bar)
```

*Be careful with unbinding and rebinding!* Treating your container as mutable can make it very
easy to get into a confusing situation where the bindings between your components are unclear.
This functionality is primarily provided to make setting up integration tests easier &mdash;
avoid using it at runtime.
